# Cypress Angular e2e test app

Run [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) e2e tests against you Angular app.

Make sure to start your angular app before running the tests. Normally this is done by the command `npm start`.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm test` to execute the whole end-to-end tests.

Run `npm test:kendo` to just run the kendo test suite.

## Develop end-to-end tests

Run `npm start` to open the cypress electron app where you can interact with the tests.
